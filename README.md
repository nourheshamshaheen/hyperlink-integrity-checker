<b>Hyperlinks Integrity Checker</b>

_Description_ 

Automatic Hyperlink Validation for web documents and websites is an essential task for website and serversâ€™ administrators. It helps detect broken links, corrupt files and also is very useful in tracking changes that happen to websites over time, which are all too difficult to be done manually, especially with the rapid growth of websites and online document directories. A typical checker that performs such task takes two input parameters; first, it takes the URL of the document at which it should start the check, considers this document as the root, and recursively checks all the hyperlinks in this document it leads to. The second input parameter is the cut-off threshold, which is essential to prevent indefinite execution of the program.

This is a simple program that takes the inputs mentioned in the description and does the required check. This application is multi-threaded i.e. it uses threads to run multiple tasks in parallel to increase efficiency and without giving erroneous output or repetition overhead.
